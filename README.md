# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are creating an interactive dashboard for volunteers of a study. This study includes identifying bacteria in the belly buttons of the volunteers. This dashboard is for the volunteers who can identify themselves with an ID number. The dashboard includes a dropdown menu on the left side of the page that allows each volunteer to select their own ID number. Under this dropdown menu is a table that displays demographic information about each volunteer. The demographic information includes ID number, ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and washing frequency.

Also on this dashboard are three different graphs. There is a horizontal bar chart that indicates the top ten bacteria cultures that were found in each volunteer. The number of cultures found are displayed on the x axis and the y axis lists the ID numbers for each bacteria culture.

Next to the bar chart, there is a gauge chart that shows the number of scrubs per week a volunteer does on their belly button. This gauge has a range of zero to ten and allows for the volunteer to clearly see their number and to see where they fall in the color scheme. 

Under these charts is a bubble chart. This chart shows the bacteria cultures per sample. This graph allows volunteers to visualize which bacteria cultures were more frequent than others by looking at the size of the bubble markers and hovering over the bubble to find the labels of the bacteria.

This page was then given a new image for the jumbotron header, changed the background color of the page to slate gray to match the image, and was made mobile responsive. Overall, this project showed skills using the plotly, d3, and bootstrap libraries in JavaScript to visualize data for volunteers of this study.
